LORA TEST SUMMARY (best -> worst)

1) [Tier A] avg 3.00 (close 3.00 / mid 3.00 / large 3.00)
    lora_key: scanner_convert
    prompt:
        A scanning light passes over the woman; her clothes dissolve and she becomes nude. Single continuous
        shot. Identity lock: same subject and same face in every frame; preserve facial details (eyes, nose,
        lips, skin texture, moles, hairline). Face stays in frame and clearly visible. Head is almost still
        (no turns, nods, tilts); only tiny, slow facial micro-expressions. Body stays steady; only the
        required body parts move for the action. Wardrobe and hairstyle stay consistent unless the prompt
        explicitly changes them. Camera is locked-off with fixed focal length; no pan, tilt, roll, dolly,
        truck, or pedestal; no shake or drift. If a zoom or transition is required by the LoRA, keep it
        minimal and extremely slow, or use a single clean cut with the same framing.
